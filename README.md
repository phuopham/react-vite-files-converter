I waste so many time searching for free tools to convert my files. All of them or require local installation or need to upload to an unknown server. It even have limited convert rate per day. So i invest my time to create this tool. I introduce you:

# Files converter

Totally free, unlimited files converter. It even cooler that it doesn't need a server, it solve the problem on your own computer using ffmpeg wasm.

Any contribution is appreciated.
